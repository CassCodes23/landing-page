					<h2 class="about-title">About Us</h2>
					<p class="about-description">
						The Cozy Canine Salon & Suites is a full service pet facility
						providing quality pet care. We are guided by strong ethics, honesty
						and professionalism. Our goal is to provide safe and secure
						accommodations, while promoting a friendly and caring environment
						for all visiting pets.
					</p>
					<p class="about-description">
						The Cozy Canine Salon & Suites is a 9,000 square foot facility that
						opened in March 2016. We have an in-ground swimming pool that was
						built specifically for the dogs. It slopes from 6 to 30 inches at
						it’s deepest end, the perfect size for all dogs. We have a very
						large Doggie Day Care room filled with toys and lots of love, as
						well as webcams so you can watch all day! After the first visit, the
						dogs are pulling their owners across the lobby to get back to day
						care because they love it so much!
					</p>
					<p class="about-description">
						We have 10 Penthouse Suites, these are private rooms that were built
						to spoil your pet in. We have 17 Presidential Suites that are
						oversized and 9 of which have doggie doors for access to their own
						fenced in patio. We also have 42 economy quarters and another 18
						economy indoor/outdoor runs.
					</p>
					<p class="about-description">
						Five others have low to the floor pool view windows. All of our
						suites have 19″ color televisions, and web cams so you can log into
						our website (from your laptop or personal computer) and see exactly
						what your pet is doing. If your pet is scheduled for day care or
						pool play time while they are boarding with us, you can watch them
						from the live doggie cams that are open to the public every day.
